# XMBPC
XMB User Interface with multimedia features (Kodi/XBMC) for the PC. Replaced later by RetroArch's XMB.

This project is from 2013-2014 and got no updates since then. </br>
Designed in Windows Forms which suppported no high DPI or good animations at this time, so it has no good performance.

Supports many features and formats.
